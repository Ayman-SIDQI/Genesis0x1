# Genesis0x1
Summary: This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make me work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.

# How to run it!
Welcome to my 2D game! In order to run the game in simple, no enemy mode, please follow these steps:

    1 - After cloning this repository, Make the game by running the command "make" in your terminal.
    2 - Run the game by typing "./so_long maps/mp.ber" in your terminal.
    3 - If you wish to create your own map, simply place it in the "maps" directory.

To run the game in enemy mode, simply suffix your map name with "_bonus.ber" and use the command "./so_long_bonus maps/mapname_bonus.ber" in the terminal.

Enjoy the game!
